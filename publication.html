                        <p class="JQellipsis d-md-none content-fs">Developing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts in neutral media to avoid the deterioration of electrodes or
                        catalysts under harsh environments has become the ultimate goal in electrochemical water splitting. This work
                        demonstrates the fabrication of an on-chip bifunctional two-dimensional (2D) monolayer (ML) WSe<sub>2</sub>/graphene heterojunction
                        microreactor for efficient overall water splitting in a neutral medium (pH = 7). Through the synergistic atomic growth
                        of the metallic Cr dopant and graphene stitching contact on the 2D ML WSe<sub>2</sub>, the bifunctional WSe<sub>2</sub>/graphene
                        heterojunction microreactor consisting of a full-cell configuration demonstrates excellent performance for overall water
                        splitting in a neutral medium. Atomic doping of metallic Cr atoms onto the 2D ML WSe<sub>2</sub> effectively facilitates the charge
                        transfer at the solid–liquid interface. In addition, the direct growth of the self-stitching graphene contact with the

                        catalysts under harsh environments has become the ultimate goal in electrochemical water splitting. This work
                        demonstrates the fabrication of an on-chip bifunctional two-dimensional (2D) monolayer (ML) WSe2/graphene heterojunction
                        microreactor for efficient overall water splitting in a neutral medium (pH = 7). Through the synergistic atomic growth
                        of the metallic Cr dopant and graphene stitching contact on the 2D ML WSe<sub>2</sub>, the bifunctional WSe<sub>2</sub>/graphene
                        heterojunction microreactor consisting of a full-cell configuration demonstrates excellent performance for overall water
                        splitting in a neutral medium. Atomic doping of metallic Cr atoms onto the 2D ML WSe<sub>2</sub> effectively facilitates the charge
                        transfer at the solid–liquid interface. In addition, the direct growth of the self-stitching graphene contact with the
                        2D WSe<sub>2</sub> catalyst largely reduces the contact resistance of the microreactor and further improves the overall water
                        splitting efficiency. A significant reduction of the overpotential of nearly 1000 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at the Cr-doped

                        communities due to their solution-processable nature. However, the poor stability of organic molecules may hinder their
                        practical application in photovoltaic devices. Instead of conventional organometallic 2D nanosheets with low
                        weatherability, an air-stable π-conjugated 2D bis(dithiolene)iron(II) (FeBHT) coordination nanosheet (CONASH) is
                        synthesized via bottom-up liquid/liquid interfacial polymerization using benzenehexathiol (BHT) and iron(II) ammonium
                        sulfate [Fe(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] as precursors. The uncoordinated thiol groups in FeBHT are easily oxidized, but the
                        Fe(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> dissociation rate is slow, which facilitates the protection of sulfur groups by iron(II) ions. The
                        density functional theory calculates that the resultant FeBHT network gains the oxygen-repelling function for oxidation
                        suppression. In air, the FeBHT CONASH exhibits self-powered photoresponses with short response times ( &lt; 40 ms) and a
                            spectral responsivity of 6.57 mA W<sup>-1</sup>, a specific detectivity of 3.13 x 1011 Jones and an external quantum efficiency
                            of 2.23% under 365 nm illumination. Interestingly, the FeBHT self-powered photodetector reveals extremely high
                            long-term air stability, maintaining over 94% of its initial photocurrent after aging for 60 days without
                            encapsulation. These results open the prospect of using organometallic 2D materials in commercialized optoelectronic

                        efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, a detailed understanding on the photocarrier dynamics in
                        PSCs consisting of fullerene-passivated SnO<sub>2</sub> ETLs is still lacking. Here, we use ultrafast pump-probe transient
                        absorption spectroscopy to analyze the corresponding photocarrier dynamics across fullerene-modified SnO<sub>2</sub> ETLs in PSCs.
                        Both the C<sub>60</sub> pyrrolidine tris-acid (CPTA)-modified SnO<sub>2</sub> ETL and 6,6-phenyl C<sub>61</sub>-butyric acid methyl ester
                        (PC<sub>61</sub>BM)-modified SnO<sub>2</sub> ETL which have a favorable energy band edge alignment to perovskites, result in an enhanced
                        electron injection rate after introducing these two fullerenes into SnO<sub>2</sub>-based PSCs compared to the SnO<sub>2</sub> ETL without
                        modification. Moreover, combining chemical measurements and density functional theory simulation results, it is
                        confirmed that the interfacial chemical bond is tailored between the SnO<sub>2</sub> surface and carboxylic acids of CPTA, thus
                        establishing interface dipoles. Due to the existence of interface dipoles, the chemisorption of the CPTA fullerene
                        functions as a recombination suppressor both at the CPTA-passivated SnO2/perovskite interface and inside perovskites. By
                        contrast, the physisorption of the PC61BM fullerene on the SnO<sub>2</sub> ETL exhibits relatively high recombination rates both at
                        the SnO<sub>2</sub>/perovskite interface and inside perovskites. Therefore, the PSC based on the SnO<sub>2</sub>/CPTA ETL yields a PCE of more
                        than 19%, which is superior to that of the reference PSC using PC<sub>61</sub>BM as a passivator ( &lt; 18%). This study describes that
                            interfacial carrier dynamics in PSCs consisting of fullerene-modified ETLs can be clearly resolved using ultrafast
                            spectroscopy, which further provides guidance for future design for interfacial modification of ETLs.</p>

                        for high-quality photonic devices such as single-mode lasers. However, for perovskite-based single-mode lasers to become
                        practical, fabrication and integration on a chip via the standard top-down lithography process are strongly desired. The
                        chief bottleneck to achieving lithography of perovskites lies in their reactivity to chemicals used for lithography as
                        illustrated by issues of instability, surface roughness, and internal defects with the fabricated structures. The
                        realization of lithographic perovskite single-mode lasers in large areas remains a challenge. In this work, a

                        high-quality and high-crystallinity single-mode laser arrays. The self-healing process is compatible with the standard

                        is demonstrated with a low threshold of 3.8 µJ cm<sup>-2</sup>. Moreover, the control of the lasing wavelength is made possible
                        over a range of up to 6.4 nm by precise fabrication of the laser cavities. This work presents a general and promising

                        <p class="JQellipsis d-md-none content-fs">Recently, a new seeding growth approach for perovskite thin films is reported to significantly enhance the device performance of perovskite solar cells.

Overcoming the conventional transfer technique by which only planar graphene/Si Schottky junctions are currently available, this work demonstrates the 3D pyramid-like graphene/p-Si Schottky junction photocathode, which greatly enhances light harvesting efficiency and exhibits promising photo-electrochemical performance for hydrogen generation.

                        <p class="JQellipsis d-md-none content-fs">The will to circumvent capacity fading, Li dendrite formation, and low coulombic efficiency in anode-free Li-metal batteries (AFLMBs) requires a radical change in the science underpinning new materials discovery, battery design, and understanding electrode interfaces. Herein, a Cu current collector formed with ultrathin multilayer graphene grown <i>via</i> chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was used as an artificial layer to stabilize the electrode interface and sandwich-deposited Li with Cu.

                        <p class="d-none d-md-inline content-fs">The will to circumvent capacity fading, Li dendrite formation, and low coulombic efficiency in anode-free Li-metal batteries (AFLMBs) requires a radical change in the science underpinning new materials discovery, battery design, and understanding electrode interfaces. Herein, a Cu current collector formed with ultrathin multilayer graphene grown <i>via</i> chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was used as an artificial layer to stabilize the electrode interface and sandwich-deposited Li with Cu.

                        <p class="JQellipsis d-md-none content-fs">This work reveals the intrinsic carrier transport behavior of 2D organolead halide perovskites based on phase-pure homologous (n = 1, 2, and 3) Ruddelsden–Popper perovskite (RPP) (BA)<sub>2</sub>(MA)<sub>n-1</sub>Pb<sub>n</sub>I<sub>3n+1</sub> single crystals. The 2D perovskite field effect transistors with high-quality exfoliated 2D perovskite bulk crystals are fabricated, and characteristic output and transfer curves are measured from individual single-crystal flakes with various <i>n</i> values under different temperatures.

                        <p class="JQellipsis d-md-none content-fs">Optical gating derived from persistent photodoping is a promising technique that can control the transport behavior of two-dimensional (2D) materials through light modulation. The advantage of photoinduced doping is that the doping can be controlled precisely and spatially by tuning the light intensity and position. As most photoinduced doping methods suffer from a low doping level, persistent, strong photodoping was conducted in this study in TiO<sub>x</sub>–MoS<sub>2</sub> heterostructures under ultraviolet (UV) illumination, which precisely controlled the doping to a high level (1.5 × 1013 cm<sup>-2</sup>) with a trap-mediated mechanism. This mechanism was confirmed by controlling the doping level with various UV pretreatment doses. After photodoping, devices displayed superior mobility, which is a characteristic of the modulation doping used in high-electron-mobility transistors. The modulation doping sites in the inner TiOx layer were far from the channel surface (MoS<sub>2</sub>); thus, the channel was able to preserve its high-mobility property even after doping. This dose-dependent, strong, and persistent photodoping phenomenon can render the TiO<sub>x</sub>–MoS<sub>2</sub> heterostructure suitable for use in UV detectors and in nonvolatile light-driven memory products. Moreover, by using spatially controlled light scans, selective photodoping at the contact edges can dramatically reduce the contact resistance without destroying the on–off ratio of the device by forming an n<sup>+</sup>–n–n<sup>+</sup> channel. Because TiO<sub>x</sub>–MoS<sub>2</sub> heterostructures are versatile, they provide a compelling platform for high-performance 2D optoelectronic devices.</p>

                        <p class="JQellipsis d-md-none content-fs">The electrical contact to two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor materials is decisive to the electronic performance of 2D semiconductor field-effect devices (FEDs). The presence of a Schottky barrier often leads to a large contact resistance, which seriously limits the channel conductance and carrier mobility measured in a two-terminal geometry. In contrast, Ohmic contact is desirable and can be achieved by the presence of a nonrectifying or tunneling barrier. Here, we demonstrate that a nonrectifying barrier can be realized by contacting indium (In), a low work function metal, with layered InSe because of a favorable band alignment at the In–InSe interface. The nonrectifying barrier is manifested by Ohmic contact behavior at T = 2 K and a low barrier height, Φ<sub>B</sub> = 50 meV. This Ohmic contact enables demonstration of an on-current as large as 410 μA/μm, which is among the highest values achieved in FEDs based on layered semiconductors. A high electron mobility of 3700 and 1000 cm<sup>2</sup>/V·s is achieved with the two-terminal In–InSe FEDs at T = 2 K and room temperature, respectively, which can be attributed to enhanced quality of both conduction channel and the contacts. The improvement in the contact quality is further proven by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study, which suggests that a reduction effect occurs at the In–InSe interface. The demonstration of high-performance In–InSe FEDs indicates a viable interface engineering method for next-generation, 2D semiconductor-based electronics.</p>

                        <p class="JQellipsis d-md-none content-fs">We have demonstrated two novel donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) hole-transport material (HTM) with spiro[fluorene-9,9′-phenanthren-10′-one] as the core structure, which can be synthesized through a low-cost process in high yield. Compared to the incorporation of the conventional HTM of commonly used 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[<i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD), the synthesis process is greatly simplified for the presented D–A–D materials, including a minimum number of purification processes. This results in an increased production yield (&gt; 55 %) and suppressed production cost (&lt; 30 g<sup>-1</sup>), in addition to high power conversion efficiency (PCE) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The PCE of a PSC using our D–A–D HTM reaches 16.06 %, similar to that of Spiro-OMeTAD (16.08 %), which is attributed to comparable hole mobility and charge-transfer efficiency. D–A–D HTMs also provide better moisture resistivity to prolong the lifetime of PSCs under ambient conditions relative to their Spiro-OMeTAD counterparts. The proposed new type of D–A–D HTM has shown promising performance as an alternative HTM for PSCs and can be synthesized with high production throughput.</p>

                        <p class="JQellipsis d-md-none content-fs">Large-area graphene is commonly prepared through chemical vapor deposition (CVD); in situ and nondestructive methods for its characterization are desirable. In this paper, we demonstrate a practical method—exploiting magnetic dipole resonance and coupling effects—with which the Raman signals of graphene on copper (Cu) foil can be directly, faithfully, and greatly enhanced. The magnetic dipole resonance of a silicon nanoparticle (SiNP) can effectively couple its electromagnetic field with the Cu foil to induce an enormous electric field located solely at the position of the SiNP on the graphene. The coupled electromagnetic field can lead to hot spots of high electric field intensity (E<sup>2</sup>/E<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> = 123.2) within the graphene. Even when we positioned only a few SiNPs upon the graphene/Cu foil, we obtained a Raman signal enhancement (ca. 206 times) much greater than that of graphene transferred onto a 300 nm oxide film (ca. 12 times). From a series of experiments comparing the Raman signals of graphene before and after removing the SiNPs on the graphene/Cu foil, we found that the coated SiNPs had almost no effect on the quality of the as-grown graphene. Furthermore, we have used the SiNP-enhanced Raman signals to distinguish the local quality of as-grown graphene at different areas and, therefore, the quality of the underlying Cu foil. Thus, this approach based on magnetic dipole resonance and coupling appears to be very useful for in situ and nondestructive characterization of as-grown graphene on Cu foil, without the need for transfer processes or harmful processing conditions.</p>

                        <p class="JQellipsis d-md-none content-fs">This work presents an ultrahigh gain InSe-based photodetector by using a novel approach called the surface oxidation doping (SOD) technique. The carrier concentration of multilayered two-dimensional (2D) InSe semiconductor surface has been modulated by controlling the formation of a surface oxide layer. The SOD through surface charge transfer at the interface of the oxide/2D InSe semiconductor heterostructure can lead to the creation of a vertical built-in potential and band bending as a result of the carrier concentration distribution gradient. The internal electric field caused by the formation of a carrier concentration gradient in InSe layers can facilitate charge separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs under light illumination. Consequently, the record high photoresponsivities of InSe-based photodetector with ∼5 × 10<sup>6</sup> A/W at the excitation wavelength of 365 nm and 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> A/W at the wavelength of 530 nm can be obtained, outperforming the majority of photodetectors based on other 2D materials, such as graphene, MoS<sub>2</sub>, and even highly sensitive multilayer GaTe and In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> flakes. The approach based on SOD induced efficient photogenerated charge separation can be also applied to other 2D layered semiconductors.</p>

Regulated by annealing temperature and the activation energies of the intermediate and perovskite, deduced from analysis of temperature-dependent structural kinetics, the intermediate phase is found to selectively mature first and then melt along the layering direction for epitaxial conversion into perovskite crystals.

                        <p class="JQellipsis d-md-none content-fs">The presence of the PbI<sub>2</sub> passivation layers at perovskite crystal grains has been found to considerably affect the charge carrier transport behaviors and device performance of perovskite solar cells. This work demonstrates the application of a novel light-modulated scanning tunneling microscopy (LM-STM) technique to reveal the interfacial electronic structures at the heterointerfaces between CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite crystals and PbI<sub>2</sub> passivation layers of individual perovskite grains under light illumination. Most importantly, this technique enabled the first observation of spatially resolved mapping images of photoinduced interfacial band bending of valence bands and conduction bands and the photogenerated electron and hole carriers at the heterointerfaces of perovskite crystal grains. By systematically exploring the interfacial electronic structures of individual perovskite grains, enhanced charge separation and reduced back recombination were observed when an optimal design of interfacial PbI<sub>2</sub> passivation layers consisting of a thickness
